Are you finding it difficult to integrate your blog or website with HubSpot marketing software? Are you worried that you’ll lose on HubSpot’s inbound marketing capabilities because your website is using Joomla, Drupal or WordPress CMS? Well, if you’ve been asking yourself these questions, then you’ve just landed on the right page.

It’s no secret that the HubSpot’s inbound marketing strategy—which is provided in a marketing software—can help you attract visitors to your website, convert them into leads and eventually persuade them to be your loyal customers. If you have a HubSpot marketing software, then you are assured that you’ll not only have increased online presence but also increased conversion rates from visitors to leads who’ll eventually turn into customers.

Many businesses have used the HubSpot’s inbound marketing strategy to grow their business by turning their websites and blogs into magnets—which engages their prospects with the appropriate landing pages, the calls to action and personalized emails that target the right customers. But here’s the fact: most firms would like to use their own CMS—whether Joomla, Drupal or WordPress—besides the HubSpot’s marketing software even though HubSpot has its own CMS.

In this article, we walk you through the process of linking your blog or website that’s been developed using either with Joomla, Drupal, Magento or WordPress with HubSpot’s marketing software.
