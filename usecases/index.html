<h1 id="testimonials">Testimonials</h1>

<p>We contracted Integration Agent to help with a few Selective Sync campaigns between Salesforce and HubSpot.</p>

<p>Denis was able to provide quick turn arounds, troubleshooting, and explanations for what was being done and any problems that may arise in advance.</p>

<p>He made it easy to avoid major problems and was very professional and easy to work with throughout the implementation.</p>

<p><strong><em>Karri Scott / Sr. Digital Strategist, Runner Agency</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<p>We worked with Denis from Integration Agent in order to improve our customer support portal hosted on Freshdesk. Denis was quick to understand what we wanted to do and executed it in a timely manner.</p>

<p>Denis reacted quickly and efficiently when we requested changes. The communication with Denis was very easy, no need for pages long specification.</p>

<p>Highly recommended!</p>

<p><strong><em>Marc Journeux / President, Aitac</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Denis with Integration Agent developed a Salesforce.com Performance Calculator tool for our microturbine electric generator products.</p>

<p>Denis was very professional and communicated clearly with us to finalize requirements and work through complex engineering calculations together.</p>

<p>The Performance Calculator tool has made our distributors more independent, and has helped our distributors close more sales over the past year.</p>

<p>Thanks Integration Agent for the excellent work!</p>

<p><strong><em>Michael Hamilton / Applications Engineer, Capstone Turbine Corporation</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Denis of Integration Agent provided a cost-effective way for us to move data from a difficult-to-export system into HubSpot. We required a number of sample imports and testing of the data migration along the way. Denis was patient and thorough.</p>

<p><strong><em>Anne Lehan / Marketing Director at FDAImports.com, LLC</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Working with Denis of Integration Agent was extremely refreshing. Excellent communicator and goes beyond an expectation we had. Extremely happy with our results and the new relationship.</p>

<p><strong><em>September Dohrmann / Marketing Director at FDAImports.com, LLC</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Denis developed an elegant, clean and user-friendly solution in HubSpot for an event registration module that not only integrates with HubSpot forms, but also with PayPal for payment. He was a delight to work with, responding quickly to feedback and ready with clear instructions.</p>

<p>I highly recommend Denis with Integration Agent, and look forward to working with him again.</p>

<p><strong><em>Christine B. Whittemore / Chief Simplifier at Simple Marketing Now LLC</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Denis helped us create a workflow between Salesforce and HubSpot that wasn&rsquo;t present in the standard integration that exists between the two platforms.</p>

<p>Without too much explanation he easily understood what we were trying to accomplish, and was able to execute the project on time.</p>

<p>I really liked that he seems to be up to speed on a lot of the newer functionality within Salesforce and was able to utilize some of these new tools (Process Builder) to reduce the number of hours needed. I would definitely recommend Denis with Integration Agent for any integration projects you might need some custom development on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Trent Boorman / Systems Analyst at SASB</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<p>We’ve been fortunate finding Denis with Integration Agent and having us do HubSpot integration for us.
His work has been key to getting a range of features and capabilities in place on our website.
In addition, his expert counsel and quick work has been a Godsend.</p>

<p><strong><em>Kevin Shayne / Director of Marketing at CADD Edge</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Denis from Integration Agent was a great find! He had the skills to handle our Hubspot to Freshdesk integration out of the box so there was no cost for him to learn about either platform.
We met and discussed deliverables and they were done a week later. When minor changes were requested he handled it quickly.</p>

<p>He was available to bounce ideas off of regarding other integrations which we proceeded with and had the same speedy results.</p>

<p>My team is very happy with how much more connected our platforms feel and how it allows them to be more productive. I whole heartedly recommend Denis and Integration Agent.</p>

<p><strong><em>Laureen Jandroep / CEO of Certification Coaching</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<p>We hired Denis to support us to integrate Xero to our new CRM System. Denis did a fantastic job. We agreed on a time frame for the work to be completed. Denis completed before the deadline. He was very helpful through out the process.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend Denis with Integration Agent he is professional and reliable.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lucy Doig / CEO at Sign Loop Interpreting Services</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<p>The work Integration Agent has done goes beyond what I hoped would be possible to accomplish! I&rsquo;d recommend the company without hesitation.</p>
